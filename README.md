# riley-dot-files
A place to store various dotfiles and misc other things I use semi-often when setting a machine up

Obviously edit any instances of /home/riley with your own if you actually want to use my script for some weird reason (and also uncomment/add lines for whatever distro you're on...)

minecraft service requires you to put server instances in /srv/minecraft (and also kinda doesn't work well...)
